# Lead-Scoring-Assignment
To analyze the accountability of leads generated by an online education platform and to score each lead between 0-100 which will help the sales team to identify hot leads can be used for better lead conversion. 
The problem X Education is facing is that they have a high volume of leads but a low conversion rate. They want to improve this by identifying a subset of leads that are more likely to convert, which they have referred to as "Hot Leads." The company has hired me to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of conversion and lower scores indicating a lower likelihood. The CEO has set a target conversion rate of around 80% and I need to work towards that goal.
# The main objectives of this assignment is:
- To develop a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of conversion and     lower scores indicating a lower likelihood.
- To be able to adjust the model to any future requirements or problems presented by the company.
- To include these adjustments in the final presentation where recommendations will be made to the company.
